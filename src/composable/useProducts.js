      'As the number of services using internet communications such as broadband internet, internet telephony, and IPTV increases, the need for high-performance network equipment is increasing. This is no exception in areas where population density is low and where there are few customers. You can plan more effectively in terms of network deployment costs. The V5816 is a compact GPON OLT system with 4 GPON ports, 4 1G/10GBase-R ports for uplink, and 4 1000Base-T ports, making it suitable for low-density and low-cost FTTx services. V5816 supports Gigabit ports and is applicable to various network environments. In addition, the redundant power supply is realized so that the network system is not interrupted, ensuring stable service.',
